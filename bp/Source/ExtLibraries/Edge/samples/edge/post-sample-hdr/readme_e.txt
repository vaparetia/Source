<Point of Sample Program>

This sample demonstrates image post-processing on SPU performed with HDR values.


<Description of Sample Program>

The scene is rendered to a multiple render target, which is organized as follows:
mrt0: colors (as FP16 luminance, u8n U,V)
mrt1: motion vectors + linear depth

Before the flip happens the current render targets are copied from local memory to XDR memory and
the previous post-processing output is copied from XDR to localmemory for display.
Then SPU post-processing is kicked on SPU.

Post-processing on SPU is done in the following order:
1) depth of field
2) motion blur
3) Average luminance calculation
4) bloom
5) internal lens reflection

<Running the Program>
	- The left and right analog sticks, and the dpad up/down move the camera.
	- The square button toggle animation
	- Right/Left buttons cycle through tweakables
	- Triangle/Cross buttons alter current tweakable
