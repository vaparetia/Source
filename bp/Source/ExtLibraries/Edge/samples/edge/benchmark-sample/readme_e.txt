<Point of Sample Program>

This sample is used to benchmark the performance of various Edge Geometry runtime functions.

<Description of Sample Program>

Functionality-wise, this sample is very similar to the Edge character-sample.  This sample features additional timing
functionality in the Edge Geometry job, which times the performance of each function called.  The results are collected
and displayed as a text overlay.  In addition to the raw SPU cycles spent in each function, the results are displayed
as a cycles/<element> count and a percentage of the total Edge Geometry job time.  Data is also display regarding job
manager overhead and SPU ring buffer stalls.
