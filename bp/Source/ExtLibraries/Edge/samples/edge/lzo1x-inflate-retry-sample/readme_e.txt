<Point of Sample Program>

This sample shows how to detect and retry a decompression if there is a data error. It loads a compressed file and passes the
compressed data in to Edge LZO to be decompressed by an SPU. However, before doing that it simulates a file read error by
corrupting a byte in the compressed data. This corrupt data will cause the SPU to report back that there was a data error. The
PPU will reload the data and repeat the decompression until a succesful decompression is done. It then checks that the output
uncompressed data agrees with the master file which was previously used to create the compressed version offline.

Note that all output of this program is over TTY and there is nothing onscreen.

The compressed data used in this sample must be no greater than 64K.  The uncompressed data may be greater than this, since
LZO1X compressed data can be more than 6% bigger than the uncompressed data in the worst case.


<Description of Sample Program>

The uncompressed file ("assets/bs_cube.dae") is the same as the file from lzo1x-simple-deflate-sample.  The compressed file
("assets/bs_cube.dae.lzo1x") is a copy of the compressed file created by lzo1x-simple-deflate-sample.  The first 4 bytes of the
compressed file gives the uncompressed size, and the remainder is the LZO1X compressed data.

The program creates a SPURS Taskset and an Inflate Queue, then creates an Inflate Task which it attaches to that Taskset. The
Inflate Queue will have decompression work put onto it, and the Inflate Task(s) which run on SPU(s) will pull from it and
process the work.

The sample only creates 1 Inflate Task, but can create multiple tasks by setting kNumInflateTasks to a greater value. You should
create one task for each SPU that you want the decompression to be performed on in parallel. In this example, because there is
only a single element being put on the queue, creating more than one task wouldn't help, but in the general case having multiple
tasks would allow separate segments to be decompressed simultaneously by multiple SPUs. There's no reason to ever want to create
more Inflate Tasks than there are SPUs though.

The compressed data read in is intentionally damaged so that the SPU will report back an error.

The counter "s_numElementsToDecompress" is initialized to 1.

The element is put on the Inflate Queue to request that the compressed data be decompressed. The Inflate Task will wake up on an
SPU and take this element off the list. It will fetch the compressed data from main memory into Local Store, decompress it
within Local Store, then send out the uncompressed data back out to the specified Effective Address.

Once the SPU has finished sending out the uncompressed data it will then decrement the numElementsToDecompress counter in main
memory. If there was an error during decompression, the SPU will set the high bit of numElementsToDecompress (which is normally
zero). Because this decrement takes the counter (low 31 bits) to zero this means all the work we were waiting for has finished,
so it signals the specified Event Flag.

Meanwhile, the PPU has been sleeping on cellSpursEventFlagWait, waiting for the work to be signalled as done. Since the work is
now considered to the done, the PPU Thread can now wake up again. It checks the high bit of numElementsToDecompress. If it is
set then there was an error in the compressed data, and it will try again. After 5 forced failed times, we simulate a successful
disc read and leave the data unmodified so that it can be decompressed successfully. When the PPU sees the successful
decompression (because the high bit of the counter didn't get set) it will shut down everything and verify that decompression
gave the correct results.
