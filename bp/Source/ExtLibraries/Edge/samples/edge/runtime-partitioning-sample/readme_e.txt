Procedurally generates some simple geometry , which is then partitioned at runtime
on the PPU, and rendered using Edge Geometry on the SPUs.

<Point of Sample Program>
  This sample builds on the concepts in the Edge vertexes-only-sample to demonstrate
  the integration of the traditionally offline libedgegeomtool partitioner into PPU
  runtime code.  This technique is *not* recommended for final release builds, but is
  suitable for quick internal prototypes, or to facilitate runtime hot-swapping of
  geometry assets during development.

<Description of Sample Program>
  The output of the program should be a simple textured sphere.  The sphere is animated
  using both skinning (to rotate the sphere back and forth along the Z axis) and blend
  shapes (to grow and contract the sphere along the Y axis).
