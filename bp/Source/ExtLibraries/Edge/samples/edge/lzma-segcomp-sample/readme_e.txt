<Point of Sample Program>

This sample shows how an offline tool can work for splitting a file into segments and then compressing them offline. The tool
reconcatenates the compressed segments into a single smaller file which may be used in the place of the master file. This file
can then be decompressed by passing the separate segments into Edge LZMA in order to retreive the original master file.

Note that all output of this program is over TTY and there is nothing onscreen.


<Description of Sample Program>

There is an offline tool in the "host" folder which shows segmented compression.
There are also PPU and SPU libraries for interfacing with the segmented file created.  

The "lzma-segcomp-sample" program loads the master file and splits it into appropriate sized segments. Each segment is then compressed
separately. The program then writes out a file containing a header and TOC (Table of Contents),
followed by all the compressed data for the segments. If compression actually made the data larger, then the uncompressed
version of the data is used and this is flagged in the file format appropriately.

The PPU and SPU libraries provide functions for parsing the file and adding elements to the Inflate Queue for the file to be
decompressed.

This sample is used as a building block for other Edge LZMA samples.

<Running the Program>
    - Run the lzma-segcomp-sample offline tool in order to convert an input file into a segmented compressed file.
    - Pass the name of the file to convert as a parameter.

<Notice>
Users using Windows Vista might get following error while compiling the host tool:
"g++.exe: installation problem, cannot exec `cc1plus': No such file or directory"
This is a known GCC bug with Vista. ( http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=33281 )
