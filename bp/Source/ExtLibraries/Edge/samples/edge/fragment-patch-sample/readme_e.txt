<Point of Sample Program>

This sample demonstrates how to patch fragment program constants on the SPU, through the use of user code added to an Edge Geometry job.

<Description of Sample Program>

This program patches fragment program constants for each object (of which there are 128 -elephants-) in the scene.  Since each elephant
contains multiple prepartitioned segments (and thus, corresponds to multiple Edge Geometry jobs), the patch is applied during the job
corresponding to the first segment of each object.  On the SPU side, the Edge Geometry job has been modified to DMA a structure containing
information for the patch, the full fragment program micro code, and the patch values from main memory to SPU local store, to copy the patch
values into the appropriate offsets in the microcode, to DMA the resulting ucode to free space in video memory (allocated from a hybrid buffer),
and to add the appropriate commands to update the parameter to the command buffer via cellGcmSetUpdateFragmentProgramParameter().  On the PPU
side, the sizes of the command buffer holes precomputed in the offline tools are increased to hold the additional command (although, in a 
production situation, this would be best handled by the tools themselves).
