<Point of Sample Program>

This sample allows to compare fullscreen vs quarter-resolution motion blur.


<Description of Sample Program>

The scene is rendered to a multiple render target, which is organized as follows:
mrt0: colors
mrt1: motion vectors

Before the flip happens the current render targets are copied from local memory to XDR memory and
the previous post-processing output is copied from XDR to local memory for display.
Then SPU post-processing is kicked on SPU.
