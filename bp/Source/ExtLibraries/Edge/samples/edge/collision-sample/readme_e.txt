<Point of Sample Program>

This sample is an example of adding user code to an Edge Geometry job, in the form of a Ray-Triangle
collision test.  

<Description of Sample Program>

This sample creates two types of EdgeGeom jobs.  The first is similar to the jobs in
the geom- and elephant- samples, decompressing data, skinning and culling, compressing output, and filling
the command buffer hole.  The second job is specific to the intersection tests; it decompresses data and
skins the geometry, then transforms the vertices into the ray's local space for the intersection tests.  
Once a segment's nearest intersection has been computed, the job uses atomic operations to read the current 
globally nearest intersection point from main memory, and if appropriate, write the current segment's 
nearest collision point back to main memory.  A line will be drawn along the normal at the nearest 
intersection point.  A '+' is displayed in the center of the screen to indicate where the ray is being
shot from.  The position is hardcoded for a 720p resolution.

<Running the Program>
	- The left and right analog sticks, and the dpad up/down move the camera.  
	- The ray used in intersection tests is the camera look-at vector.
