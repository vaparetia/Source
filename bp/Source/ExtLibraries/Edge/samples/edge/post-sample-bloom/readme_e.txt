<Point of Sample Program>

This sample demonstrates average luminance calculation and bloom effect image post-processing on SPU.
This sample also shows how to optimize an Edge Post effect chain by:
- minimizing DMA usage by coalescing multiple passes together
- choosing appropiate intermediate pixel format to avoid redundant conversions

<Description of Sample Program>

Before the flip happens the current render target is copied from local memory to XDR memory and
the previous post-processing output is copied from XDR to localmemory for display.
Then SPU post-processing is kicked on SPU.

This sample only implements the Bloom effect and average luminance calculation.

<Running the Program>
	- The left and right analog sticks, and the dpad up/down move the camera.
	- The square button toggle animation
	- Right/Left buttons cycle through tweakables
	- Triangle/Cross buttons alter current tweakable
