<Point of Sample Program>

This sample demonstrates the effects of varying the number of SPUs, the SPURS Max Grab, and the total ring buffer size
on performance.  Users can build intuition about the effects that modifying parameters have on RSX and SPU processing
times.

<Running the Program>
	- The left and right analog sticks, and the dpad up/down move the camera.
        - Press cross to enable/disable menu.  (Active menu is indicated by ">" icon.  Camera control is disabled while menu is active.)
        - When menu is active, dpad up and down change selection, left and right change parameter.
