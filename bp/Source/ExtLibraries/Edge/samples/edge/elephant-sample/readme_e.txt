Renders a non-trivial animated character using Edge Geometry.


<Point of Sample Program>
  This sample builds on the concepts in the Edge geom-sample to load and
  render a large, multi-segment animated elephant.

<Description of Sample Program>
  For simplicity, the elephant's animation matrices are loaded from
  a flat precomputed array.
