<Point of Sample Program>

This sample is an example of running Edge Geometry jobs with data that has not been prepartioned by the offline tools.
Only vertex related processing (no culling) is preformed on the SPUs.  

<Description of Sample Program>

This sample uses Edge Geometry jobs to decompress input vertex data, and compress the data into an output format, operating
on segments generated on the fly by the PPU to fit into local store (as limited by input/output vertex strides).

<Running the Program>
	- The left and right analog sticks, and the dpad up/down move the camera.  

<Notes>

Vertex only processing with Edge Geometry need not be limited to decompression and compression.  By adding user code, some functionality
of vertex shader programs can be moved onto the SPUs.
