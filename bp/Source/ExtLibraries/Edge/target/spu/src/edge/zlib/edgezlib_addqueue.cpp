/** 
 * @brief	Try to add a new piece of work to the Deflate Queue. The work added to this queue will be taken by
 *			one of the Deflate Tasks at the next chance they get.
 *
 * @note	This is the SPU equivalent of the PPU function of the same name.
 *
 * @note	If the queue is full (ie. reached maxNumQueueEntries), and another item is pushed onto the
 *			queue, then this function will return and not block.
 *
 * @note	The work-to-do-counter can be used to track completion of the processing on a collection
 *			of segments by initializing it to however many segments are being waited on. Then when
 *			each item completes it will decrement by one, and so when the value reaches zero all
 *			segments will have been done. At this point the specified event flag will be set.
 *			Note that if the SPU has an error with compression it will set the high bit of the
 *			counter.
 *
 * @note	If eaWorkToDoCounter is NULL, but eaEventFlag is valid, then the event flag will be set
 *			after this segment is done.
 *
 * @param	handle						The handle of the Deflate Queue that the entry will be pushed
 *										onto.
 * @param	eaInputUncompressedData		The Effective Address of the input data which is to be
 *										compressed.
 * @param	uncompressedSize			The size of the uncompressed input data.
 * @param	eaOutputCompressedData		The Effective Address of the output buffer for the
 *										compressed data.
 * @param	maxCompressedOutputSize		The maximum space available for the compressed data.
 * @param	eaOutputCompressedSize		The Effective Address of the uint32_t into which the output
 *										compressed size will be written. The top bit of the output
 *										size indicates whether the data was stored compressed or if the
 *										uncompressed original data was chosen for storing.
 * @param	eaWorkToDoCounter			A counter in main memory which will be atomically decremented
 *										after this item has been compressed.
 *										If the SPU has an error with the compression it will set the
 *										high bit of the counter to alert the fact that an error occurred.
 *										Can be NULL if you're not interested.
 * @param	eaEventFlag					The event flag to set.
 *										Can be NULL if you're not interested.
 * @param	eventFlagBits				The value to set to the event flag.
 * @param	level						Choose the compression level between 0 and 9
 *											0 - no compression
 *											1 - fastest
 *											9 - smallest
 * @param	processing					If compression makes the data bigger, choose whether to store
 *										the compressed or the original data.
 *										Also, when compressing, choose whether to store the data with
 *										zlib header and footer, or whether to store just the 'raw'
 *										compressed data without any header or footer.
 * @param	dmaTag						The DMA tag to use when adding the element to the queue
 * @return								'true' if the item was added. 'false' if it failed to add.
